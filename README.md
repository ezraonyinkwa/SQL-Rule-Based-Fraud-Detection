# SQL-Rule-Based-Fraud-Detection
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to detect and score fraudulent transactions from daily banking data. It involves building a Star Schema data model, cleaning and structuring raw transaction data, and applying rule-based fraud detection logic to identify unusual or suspicious activities.

## Key Features

- Designed a Star Schema with dimension and fact tables for efficient data modeling.

- Implemented SQL-based fraud detection rules, including high-value transactions, device sharing, location anomalies, and transaction velocity.

- Ensured data integrity and traceability across all relational tables.

## Tech Stack

- SQL (Data Cleaning, Modelling, Rule Implementation)

- Relational Database Design (Star Schema)

- Data Validation & Fraud Analytics
