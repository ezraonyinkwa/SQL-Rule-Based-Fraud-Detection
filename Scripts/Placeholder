For the fraud detection rules we are going to work on the following;

1.) High Transaction Amount (Threshold Breach).
    Flag transactions above the normal spending threshold.
2.) Multiple Transactions in a Short Time (Velocity Rule).
    Detect accounts making too many transactions in a brief window (e.g., 5 in 10 minutes).
3.) Same Device Used by Multiple Accounts.
    Identify devices (or IPs) linked to multiple customers.
4.) Transactions from Unusual Locations.
    Detect transactions from new or faraway locations for the same account.
5.) Rapid Balance Depletion.
    Flag accounts where balance drops significantly in a short period.
6.) Repeated Failed Login Attempts.
    Identify accounts with multiple failed logins before a transaction.
7.) Transactions from Multiple Devices in One Hour.
    Detect account access from multiple devices within a short timeframe.
8.) Same IP Used by Multiple Merchants.
    Spot shared IPs across merchants â€” possible collusion or fraudulent network.
9.) Inconsistent Transaction Type Behavior.
    Identify accounts performing opposite transaction types unusually fast.
10.) Odd Transaction Time (Night Hours).
     Flag transactions during suspicious time windows.
